<b>ALX SE - System Engineering (DevOps)</b>  
  
For this project, we learnt how to control permissions using the shell.  
  
<ins>su</ins> : substitute user identity  
<ins>whoami</ins> : see which user you are currently logged in as  
<ins>groups</ins> : see the groups a user is in  
<ins>chown</ins> : change file owner and group  
<ins>touch</ins> : create a new, empty file, or update the modified time of an existing one  
<ins>chmod</ins> : change file or directory mode  
<ins>mkdir</ins> : create directory(s)  
<ins>chgrp</ins> : change a file(s) group ownership  
  
  
All files created were <i>scripts</i>  
and scripts are represented with the <b>Shebang</b> notation <b>"#!"</b>  
on the first line e.g. <i>"#!/bin/bash"</i>  
  
  
The <i>man</i> pages were used to view how to use commands  
<b>Example:</b> <i>man command</i>  
<b>i.e.</b> <i>man chown</i>  
  
  
<b>SPECIAL TASK</b>  
Write a script that will play the StarWars IV episode in the terminal  
<b>Solution</b> : <i>telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</i>
